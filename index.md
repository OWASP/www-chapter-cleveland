Welcome to the OWASP Cleveland Chapter. Reactivated in May 2024, it is our goal is to meet monthly to discuss everything related to application security. Join us at one of our upcoming events to engage in conversations about the latest trends and best practices in the field.

## Upcoming Meetings
Join us on Tuesday, February 18th at [Market Avenue Wine Bar](https://marketavenuewinebar.com/) for a hands-on lab demonstration with Contrast Security. The presentation will go over features and limitations of Contrast's next generation RASP tool. This session is designed for everyone, whether you decide to participate or not.

Contrast is an Application Security solution used by companies like AARP, InfoSys, Citizens Bank, Snap Finance, and more.

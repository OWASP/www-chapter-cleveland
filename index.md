<p>
The OWASP Cleveland Chapter will host its first meeting which will kickoff on Friday, January 29, 2021 at 6:30 pm EST. The first meeting will provide an introduction to what you can expect from our chapter in 2021 and it will also serve as our first membership drive. The chapter leaders are Eric Potter, Ian Mulhern, and Princeton Brooke. Each leader has adopted an OWASP project that will be reviewed in the first meeting and then expanded-on throughout the course of 2021. We look forward to serving the OWASP community, the city of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, and security practitioners all over the world.

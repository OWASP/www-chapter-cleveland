Welcome to the OWASP Cleveland Chapter. We've just reactivated our chapter in May 2024 and begun planning meetups, so consider joining one of our upcoming events. There, we'll focus on gauging the interests of the AppSec community in Northeast Ohio, and planning future events accordingly.

## Upcoming Meetings

We're hosting a Meet & Greet on June 5, 2024 at [Market Avenue Wine Bar](https://marketavenuewinebar.com/) in Ohio City. RSVP on Meetup: [https://www.meetup.com/owasp-cleveland-group/events/300914168/](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-cleveland-group/events/300914168/)


## Chapter information

The Cleveland chapter is led by John Crynick and Eden Yardeni. We plan to provide training and networking opportunities for Cybersecurity professionals, students, enthusiasts, and businesses within the Cleveland and surrounding Northeast Ohio region. 

### OWASP Membership

Our meetups are open to the entire community, though we encourage becoming an OWASP member to support our free and open-source application security projects. Learn more here: [https://owasp.org/membership/](https://owasp.org/membership/)

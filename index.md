Welcome to the OWASP Cleveland Chapter. We are currently planning our 2021 calendar. Please bookmark our official Meetup profile to stay informed about meetings. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic status and until further notice, our meetings will be held virtually.

## Upcoming Meetings

Upcoming meeting details will be located at our [Meetup.com site](http://www.meetup.com/owasp-cleveland-group/).
We look forward to hearing from members and having open dialog on how our chapter can assist in servicing the needs of the greater OWASP organization.


## Chapter information

The Cleveland chapter is lead by John Crynick and Eden Yardeni. We plan to provide training and networking opportunities for Cybersecurity professionals, students, enthusiasts, and businesses within the Cleveland and surrounding Northeast Ohio region.
